      # Working with Lacci

      [lacci.md](mdc:docs/lacci.md)

      You are currently working in Lacci, the Shoes4 compatibility layer for Scarpe.
      For detailed documentation, see: docs/lacci.md

      Key points to remember:
      1. Lacci translates Shoes4 commands to display-agnostic operations
      2. Uses Niente (null display service) for testing
      3. Implements drawing context inheritance
      4. Handles margins, fonts, and layout

      Common patterns:
      - Test new features with Niente first
      - Follow existing error handling patterns
      - Maintain backward compatibility
      - Document changes thoroughly

examples:

      module Shoes
        class Triangle < Shape
          def initialize(app, left, top, width, height, **styles)
            super(app, left, top, width, height, **styles)
          end
        end
