      # Format Requirements

      1. First line (50 chars ideal):
         - Clear, direct statement of WHAT changed
         - Start with verb (Add, Fix, Update, etc.)

      2. Empty line after header

      3. Body must include:
         - WHY the change was needed
         - HOW it addresses the problem
         - Technical implications
         - Impact on stability/maintenance

      4. For API changes:
         - Explicitly state if using private/internal APIs
         - Note any technical debt implications
         - Include upstream context for dependency changes

examples:
  - description: "Standard feature change"
    input: |
      Add request validation to UserWidget

      Prevents invalid requests from reaching the database layer.
      Adds type checking and parameter validation before processing.

      Impact: Improved error handling and reduced DB load.

  - description: "Private API change"
    input: |
      Update FrobWidget to use internal Foo::Bar API

      Rails changed their implementation from X to Y. While both
      are private APIs, this change is required to maintain
      compatibility.

      Note: Created ticket RAIL-123 to track moving to public
      APIs when available.
