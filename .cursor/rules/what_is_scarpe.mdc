Scarpe is a modern attempt at an implementation of Why The Lucky Stiff's Shoes.rb.

It is not complete.

It is built on Webview.

Our primary goal is to as many shoes apps from `examples/legacy/not_checked` working as possible. So, you can check them for bits of DSL that aren't yet up to scratch. They used to work.

`docs/static/manual-en.txt` is our "bible". It is nearly a perfect representation of how Shoes _should_ work. It's what we want to do. With every fibre of your being I want you to help me get the not checked examples working and anything from this manual.

It is 3,500 lines long though.

To run an example to see if it's working (I'll have to check) run something like:

`SCARPE_BOOTSTRAP_THEME=sketchy bundle exec ./exe/scarpe examples/page_navigation_single_app.rb --debug
`
