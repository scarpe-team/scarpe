      # Git Pager Handling

      When running git commands that would normally use a pager (like `git diff`, `git log`, etc.), always append `| cat` to prevent the pager from breaking the output. This is especially important in automated environments.

      ## Examples

      ```bash
      # Good
      git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | cat
      git log | cat
      git show | cat

      # Bad
      git diff HEAD~1 HEAD
      git log
      git show
      ```

      ## Common Commands Needing `| cat`

      - `git diff`
      - `git log`
      - `git show`
      - `git blame`
      - Any other git command that might produce paginated output

      ## Why?

      The pager (usually `less` or `more`) expects user interaction, which isn't available in automated environments. Piping to `cat` ensures we get the full output without pagination.

examples:
  - description: "Running git diff in automated environment"
    input: |
      git diff HEAD~1 HEAD | cat
