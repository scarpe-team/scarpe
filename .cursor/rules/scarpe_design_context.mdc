      # Scarpe Design Context

      When working on Scarpe-related files, it's important to consider the design principles and decisions made during its development. Here are key documents that provide context:

      - @display_service_separation.md
      - @shoes_and_display_events.md
      - @event_loops.md
      - @timeouts_and_handlers.md
      - @calzini_components_and_updates.md
      - @scarpe_shoes_incompatibilities.md
      - @shoes_implementations.md
      - @web_archaeology.md

      These documents cover various aspects of Scarpe's design, including its relationship with Shoes, event handling, and component updates. Refer to them for a deeper understanding of the project's architecture and design choices.

examples:
  - description: "Working on a Scarpe component"
